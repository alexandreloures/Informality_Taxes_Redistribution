This repository contains three folders:

Do files - Paper: These files allow for a full replication of the paper once each country's expenditure survey data has been obtained (the master.do file details which do file correspond to which graph or table).
Do files - Country Codes : These files allow to replicate the analysis we conducted for each country from the raw data. The same methodology is used for each country, with a few exceptions listed and detailed below.
Crosswalk : These files are needed for the analysis of some countries, which product codes where not following the COICOP classification and/or when the type of retailers classification was too detailed.
